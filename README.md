# betterdiscord-sweet-theme
A theme for Betterdiscord inspired by the [Sweet](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet) color scheme. Works even better with stock [BlurpleRecolor plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/blob/master/Themes/BlurpleRecolor/BlurpleRecolor.theme.css).

*All themes go into %AppData%\BetterDiscord\themes (on Windows) / .config/Lightcord_BD/themes/ (on Linux)*
